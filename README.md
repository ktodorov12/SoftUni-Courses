# ‡ßª(  ‚Ä¢ÃÄ ·óú ‚Ä¢ÃÅ  ‡ßª) Welcome to Software University's courses
In my opinion, this repository serves as the focal point for the Software University's courses for the year 2024. It is intended to give users comprehensive understanding and useful abilities in JavaScript, with an emphasis on the language's functioning in the browser‚Äîits most popular environment.

# üìë Course Overview
This course is designed to give me a better understanding of the functionality of the JavaScript language and the environment where it is typically deployed - the browser. I will explore JavaScript's basic syntax and learn about programming concepts through the language. This course covers functional programming and differences between functional and object-oriented programming. I will study the browser elements in detail, as well as the DOM tree and how to add, remove, and edit elements within it.

One unique aspect of JavaScript is its ability to be used for both back-end and front-end development. During the training, we will learn about developing server-side applications using Node.js and Express.js. Additionally, we will cover popular technologies for building user interfaces. The course will also focus on the architecture and structuring of Single Page Applications, as well as retrieving data from a REST service via queries. During the training, we will learn how to create a server using Node.js, understand the server-client architecture, and develop efficient data-driven web applications using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB with modern techniques and tools. We will cover data views, templates, models, components, data binding, multi-view handling, routing, and extracting data from a REST service, among other topics.

Additionally, the 'Front-End' module will provide a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS web technologies. You will acquire a fundamental understanding of web development, web browsers, and the tools used for HTML/CSS/DOM development. Additionally, you will develop practical skills in using HTML, the web content description language, and CSS, the web content styling language. These skills will enable you to properly structure the front-end of web applications and style them according to a given design.
