        <h1><strong>The White Tiger</strong></h1>
        <p class="first">The white Bengal tigers are distinctive due to the color of their fur. 
            The white fur is caused by a lack of the pigment <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin#Pheomelanin">pheomelanin</a> , 
            which is 
            found in Bengal tigers with orange color fur. When compared to Bengal tigers, the white 
            Bengal tigers tend to grow faster and heavier than the orange Bengal tiger.
            They also tend to be somewhat bigger at birth, and as fully grown adults. White Bengal tigers are fully grown 
            when they are 2â€“3 years of age. White male tigers reach weights of 200 to 230 kilograms (440 to 510 lb) and can 
            grow up to 3 meters (9.8 ft) in length. As with all tigers, the white Bengal tiger's stripes are like fingerprints, 
            with no two tigers having the same pattern. The stripes of the tiger are a pigmentation of the skin; if an individual were to be 
            shaved, its distinctive coat pattern would still be visible.[2]</p>

        <h2>Genetics</h2>
        <p class="second">A white tiger's pale coloration is due to the lack of the red and yellow pheomelanin pigments that normally produce the orange coloration.[3] This had long been attributed to a mutation in the gene for the tyrosinase (TYR) enzyme. A knockout mutation in this gene results in albinism, the ability to make neither pheomelanin (red and yellow pigments) nor eumelanin (black and brown pigments), while a less severe mutation in the same gene in other mammals results in selective loss of pheomelanin, the so-called Chinchilla trait. The white phenotype in tigers had been attributed to such a Chinchilla mutation in tyrosinase,[3][4][5] and in the past white tigers were sometimes referred to as 'partial albinos'.[4][6] While whole genome sequencing determined that such a TYR mutation is responsible for the white lion leucistic variant, a normal TYR gene was found in both white tigers and snow leopards.[7] Instead in white tigers a naturally-occurring point mutation in the SLC45A2 transport protein gene was found to underlie its pigmentation. The resultant single amino acid substitution introduces an alanine residue that protrudes into the transport protein's central passageway, apparently blocking it, and by a mechanism yet to be determined this prevents pheomelanin expression in the fur.[3] Mutations in the same gene are known to result in 'cream' coloration in horses,[3] and play a role in the paler skin of humans of European descent.[8] This is a recessive trait, meaning that it is only seen in individuals that are homozygous for this mutation,[3] and that while the progeny of white tigers will all be white, white tigers can be also bred from colored Bengal tiger pairs in which each possesses a single copy of the unique mutation.[9][7] Inbreeding promotes recessive traits and has been used as a strategy to produce white tigers in captivity, but this has also resulted in a range of other genetic defects.</p>
